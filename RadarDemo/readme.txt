Radar Demo using the Dot Product
================================
This is a simple radar simulation. The radar sweeps around in a circle looking for aircraft using the 'Dot Product'. Once it finds the aircraft it remembers it's location and plots it on the scope. The aircrafts last known location will then gradually fade until the next time it gets hit. If you swing the rade too fast you will miss an aircraft (just like a real radar unit).

This radar demo was inspired by the following two submissions:
